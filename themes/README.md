# css development

The css is organized in two branches:
- in the first one, *core*, the main css for *reveal* is defined
- in the second one, *themes*, many themes are defined, to be used aside the
    main one

## Theme


## Core
In order to compile the core run:
```shell
sass reveal.scss
```
It will produce the *reveal.css* stylesheet.
