# Reorganization

## Package structure

- `slides_cli`: cli for managing slides projects
  - `init` consider to be in a new folder and initialize required material, in
    particular a `slipy.toml` file (like `git init` with `.git` folder)

## Reveal

- `minimal-reveal`: contains the minimal runtime dependency
  - `dist`: the packaged `javascript`
  - `dist/theme`: the predefined themes (`css` compiled from `scss`)
  - `dist/theme/fonts`: fonts are shipped with project
  - `plugin`: directory of plugins
  - `plugin/<plugin-name>`: the directory of each plugin, with source code and
    compiled `js` and `css`
- `src`: old scripts and templates to be rearranged in a package

### Plan

- `js`: the bundled `js` should be compiled in the main project (following
  `update.sh`) and exported
- `fonts`: export the one provided, for further ones use instead a CDN
- `css`: export full build-system for themes, in order to provide the new ones
  aside those already provided by `reveal.js`
- `plugin`: exactly as `js`, compile in the project and export the compiled (for
  simplicity export the full `plugin` folder after build)

#### scripts

- reorganize the scripts in `slipy`, with entry-point (with subcommands) in
  `slides_cli`, exploiting `libmake.py` (maybe directly inside the package), in
  order to not recompile unneeded stuffs
- ship assets/templates in a parallel python package, with importer scripts to
  make them available

Old description

# Templates - reveal.js

Since _reveal.js_ is a framework is more difficult to use as a dependency, so
I'm creating this `make.py` script to build my customize framework, copying the
submodule, that will help to keep _reveal.js_ up to date with the original
developed version.

## How to use

download updated version of _reveal.js_ and build the framework with my
customization

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt

git submodule init

python3 make.py
```

## Presentation

### How to build a presentation

Compile the `index.html` from files in `src` and bundle the javascript with
`webpack` (including everything coming from _reveal.js_), all with the specific
script.

### How to build a presentation release

Use the build script, it will provide a folder containing:

- the `index.html` entry page (that is the unique `html` content of the output)
- the `main.js` bundle generated by `wepback`
- the `main.css` bundle generated someway (`sass`)
- a tar gzipped archive, made with all the source used to produce that
  presentation (contained in the `src` folder of the framework)

### Live preview

Run `watch -n1 make`, currently the only thing that is built is the `html`.
